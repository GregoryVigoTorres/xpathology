<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class='introduction'>
    The primary purpose of XPath is to address parts of an XML document.
    In support of this primary purpose, it also provides basic facilities for manipulation of strings, numbers and booleans.
    XPath uses a compact, non-XML syntax to facilitate use of XPath within URIs and XML attribute values.
    XPath operates on the abstract, logical structure of an XML document, rather than its surface syntax.
</p>
<p class='introduction'>
    <em>In addition to its use for addressing, XPath is also designed so that it has a natural subset that can be used for matching (testing whether or not a node matches a pattern); this use of XPath is described in <strong>XSLT</strong>.</em>
</p>
<p>XPath models an XML document as a tree of nodes.</p>
<p>Xpath defines a way to compute a string value for each node type.</p>
<p>
    XPath fully supports XML Namespaces [XML Names].
    An <strong>expanded-name</strong> contains a local part and a possibly null URI namespace.
