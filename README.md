#XPathology#

A live version can probably be found at: [https://xpathology.herokuapp.com/].

This is a summary of XPath location paths, functions and things mostly derived mostly from the official W3C spec and put into a slightly easier to read format. I make no claim that it's all inclusive and it may have errors (send me a pull request). I have no affiliation with the W3C.
